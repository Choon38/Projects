# Blockchain Transaction Security System

This project serves as my Capstone project for the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, India.

### Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that allows multiple parties to securely record, store, and share information. Each record in a blockchain is called a block, which contains a list of transactions. Once a block is filled, it is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks. This structure ensures that any attempt to alter a block would require changing all subsequent blocks, making it highly secure against tampering.

### Key Features

- **Decentralization:** Unlike traditional banking systems, where a central authority manages transactions, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
- **Immutability:** Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing a permanent and transparent record of all transactions.
- **Transparency:** All participants in the network can view the transaction history, promoting trust among users.
- **Security:** Blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to secure transaction data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.

### Use Case

This project applies blockchain technology to protect banking transactions without the need for tokens. By leveraging blockchain's unique characteristics, it offers a secure platform for users to add or transfer money while maintaining a transparent and immutable record of all transactions. 

In the event of a security breach, the system alerts users through a pop-up indicating that the blockchain has been tampered with, enabling swift action to be taken to safeguard their assets.
