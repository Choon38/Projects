# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project provides a minimal setup to get React working with TypeScript in Vite, with support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for a smooth development experience.

## Features

- React with TypeScript using Vite for fast builds and optimized performance.
- Two plugin options for Fast Refresh:
  - One option uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
  - Another option uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for faster development workflow.
- ESLint for code linting and style enforcement.

## Expanding ESLint Configuration

For production applications, it's recommended to enable type-aware lint rules in ESLint for more robust code checking.
